# Custom Button Icons Tutorial 

This folder contains the fonts for the tutorial 
[Custom button icons](https://docs.neptunelabs.com/docs/tutorials/custom-buttons).

The **FSI Viewer Glyph** fonts are the standard icons used for the FSI Viewer menu bars.
By creating a custom font, you can add your own icons to personalise your skin.
The **FSI Viewer Glyph Custom** shows such a changed button icon set and
can be used as a starting point for your own customization.
